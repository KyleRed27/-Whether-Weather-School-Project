# (Whether) Weather

A web client for our waether hosting website. 

## Summary

The first page the user see will see is the Dashboard with the CityView Weather layout, giving a weather update for each city right now. Each city page can be opened to show the current weather, max temps and wind speed for that day and a 7-day forecast. From there, users can go to the Live Cams page to see a live feed of each of the major cities along with the weather conditions. On the settings page, a user can log in with their email and password to allow them to save their favourite cities as well as select their preferences for the site.
